Returns to the beautiful classic Wordpress style

== Description ==
Classic Style is a plugin that allows you to return to the classic wordpress design, that is to say, buttons and Wordpress boxes that we were used to before.
The new version 5.3 came with a Gutenberg style design which everyone has not liked this new design and many want to return to have the cute buttons that characterized Wordpress.
<br />
With this plugin you can continue enjoying the previous style of:
- buttons
- text boxes
- select
- administration tables
- help boxes
- etc...
<br />
If you have any problem with the plugin or there is still more polishing to get the classic Wordpress design, do not hesitate to write in the support forum to continue improving this complement.
